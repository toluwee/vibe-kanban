# Plan: Build and Run Production Version of Vibe-Kanban

## Problem Analysis
The user wants to build and run a production version of the vibe-kanban application. This involves:
1. Building the frontend React application
2. Building the Rust backend with release optimizations
3. Running the production build

## Todo Items

- [x] Install project dependencies (pnpm i)
- [x] Build frontend production assets
- [ ] Build backend Rust binary in release mode
- [ ] Verify build artifacts are created
- [ ] Run the production version
- [ ] Test that the application starts correctly

## Notes
- The frontend build completed successfully (870KB bundle)
- The Rust backend build is taking longer due to release optimizations
- Using build:single option to avoid building MCP task server separately
- Sentry warnings can be ignored for local builds (no auth token needed)

## Current Status
-  pnpm installed globally
-  Frontend build completed successfully
- = Backend Rust build in progress (release mode compilation)
- ï¿½ Waiting for backend build to complete before running
